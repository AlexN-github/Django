C:\PyProjects\Django\geekshop>python manage.py flush
You have requested a flush of the database.
This will IRREVERSIBLY DESTROY all data currently in the 'C:\\PyProjects\\Django\\geekshop\\db.sqlite3' database,
and return each table to an empty state.
Are you sure you want to do this?

    Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel: yes
CommandError: Database C:\PyProjects\Django\geekshop\db.sqlite3 couldn't be flushed. Possible reasons:
  * The database isn't running or isn't configured correctly.
  * At least one of the expected database tables doesn't exist.
  * The SQL was invalid.
Hint: Look at the output of 'django-admin sqlflush'. That's the SQL this command wasn't able to run.
